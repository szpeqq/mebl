## Installation

1.  Install and activate the following required plugins, in your WordPress plugin directory:

- [woocommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce) Ecommerce for WordPress.
- [wp-graphql](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql) Exposes GraphQL for WordPress.
- [wp-graphql-woocommerce](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce) Adds WooCommerce functionality to a WPGraphQL schema.
- [wp-algolia-woo-indexer](https://github.com/w3bdesign/wp-algolia-woo-indexer) WordPress plugin coded by me. Sends WooCommerce products to Algolia. Required for search to work.

Optional plugin:

- [headless-wordpress](https://github.com/w3bdesign/headless-wp) Disables the frontend so only the backend is accessible. (optional)

The current release has been tested and is confirmed working with the following versions:

- WordPress version 6.8.1
- WooCommerce version 9.9.5
- WP GraphQL version 2.3.3
- WooGraphQL version 0.19.0
- WPGraphQL CORS version 2.1

2.  For debugging and testing, install either:

    <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/apollo-developer-tools/> (Firefox)

    <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm> (Chrome)

3.  Make sure WooCommerce has some products already

4.  Clone or fork the repo. For local development, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and adjust values.

  Key variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL` – Your WPGraphQL endpoint (e.g. https://yourwp.site/graphql)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MOCKS` – Set to `true` to run without a backend using in-app mocks
  - Algolia (optional): `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_PUBLIC_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME`

  This boilerplate also includes a `render.yaml` for Render.com deployment. On Render, set the above env vars in the service settings or rely on `render.yaml` prompts for secrets.

5.  Modify the values according to your setup

6.  Install dependencies and start the server
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`

7.  Enable COD (Cash On Demand) payment method in WooCommerce

8.  Add a product to the cart

9.  Proceed to checkout

10. Fill in your details and place the order

## Lighthouse Performance Monitoring

This project uses automated Lighthouse testing through GitHub Actions to ensure high-quality web performance. On every pull request:

- Performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO are automatically evaluated
- Results are posted directly to the pull request
- Minimum score thresholds are enforced for:
  - Performance: Analyzing loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability
  - Accessibility: Ensuring WCAG compliance and inclusive design
  - Best Practices: Validating modern web development standards
  - SEO: Checking search engine optimization fundamentals
  - PWA: Assessing Progressive Web App capabilities

View the latest Lighthouse results in the GitHub Actions tab under the "Lighthouse Check" workflow.

## Troubleshooting

### I am getting a cart undefined error or other GraphQL errors

Check that you are using the 0.12.0 version of the [wp-graphql-woocommerce](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce) plugin

### The products page isn't loading

Check the attributes of the products. Right now the application requires Size and Color.

If you're running without a backend, ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MOCKS=true` is set in `.env.local` to use the built-in GraphQL mocks for development.

## Render.com Deployment

This repo includes a `render.yaml` Blueprint to deploy as a Node Web Service on Render.

- Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
- Start Command: `npm run start`
- Node version: pinned via `.node-version` (22.16.0) or set `NODE_VERSION` env var on Render
- Required environment variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL` (your WPGraphQL endpoint)
- Optional: Algolia keys and index name

Steps:
1. Push your repo to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
2. In Render Dashboard: New > Blueprint > select your repo containing `render.yaml`.
3. When prompted, provide secret values for variables marked with `sync: false` (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL`).
4. Finish creation; Render will build and run the service at an `onrender.com` URL.

Notes:
- SSR and API routes run on Render’s Node runtime. The app binds to the default `PORT` provided by Render automatically via `next start`.
- If your WooCommerce/WordPress is behind auth or firewalls, allow Render to access it or proxy accordingly.
- For preview environments or temporary lack of backend, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MOCKS=true` to serve mock catalog data.

## Issues

Overall the application is working as intended, but it has not been tested extensively in a production environment.
More testing and debugging is required before deploying it in a production environment.

With that said, keep the following in mind:

- Currently only simple products and variable products work without any issues. Other product types are not known to work.
- Only Cash On Delivery (COD) is currently supported. More payment methods may be added later.

This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## TODO

- Implement UserRegistration.component.tsx in a registration page
- Add user dashboard with order history
- Add Cloudflare Turnstile on registration page
- Ensure email is real on registration page
- Add total to cart/checkout page
- Copy billing address to shipping address
- Hide products not in stock
